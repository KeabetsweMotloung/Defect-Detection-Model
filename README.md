# Fraud Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a fraud detection system using machine learning. The goal of this project is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on various features provided in the dataset. The project includes a user-friendly web interface to interact with the model, view transaction details, and monitor real-time alerts.

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is crucial for businesses to prevent financial losses and maintain trust. This project uses a Kaggle dataset to build a model that can predict fraudulent transactions. The web application provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring and detailed analysis of transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=credit+card+fraud). It includes the following features:

- **Time:** Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1-V28:** Anonymized features derived from PCA.
- **Amount:** Transaction amount.
- **Class:** 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for non-fraudulent transactions.

## Features

- **Data Exploration and Preparation:** Initial exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing of the dataset to understand feature relationships and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Development:** Building and training a fraud detection model using techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or other suitable algorithms.
- **User Interface:** A web application where users can input transaction details and receive fraud predictions.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Notifications for suspected fraudulent transactions.
- **Transaction Analysis:** Detailed view of transaction data and risk levels.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-system.git
cd fraud-detection-system
```

### Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation:

- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

### Model Training:

- Train the fraud detection model using the prepared dataset.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### User Interface:

- Users can input transaction details (amount, anonymized features) and get a prediction on whether the transaction is fraudulent.
- The application displays real-time alerts for suspected fraudulent transactions and provides insights through visualizations.

## Results

The fraud detection model demonstrates the ability to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The web interface allows for easy interaction, real-time monitoring, and detailed transaction analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses to mitigate fraud risks.
